# First setup your rust project

Foor now you can follow the content of the [documentation of Diesel](https://diesel.rs/guides/extending-diesel.html) 
```sh
cargo new --lib diesel_demo
cd diesel_demo
cargo add diesel --features mysql
cargo add dotenvy
```

## Install diesel_cli
Here comes the problems:
```sh 
cargo install diesel_cli
```
This above code doesn't work
You need to first install the mysql connector, for that run the following:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```
Or in windows install the package from [following website](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-c/)
